<h1>A NOTE ON THE TEXT</h1>
<article>
<h6>A DIGITAL (?) EDITION</h6>
<p>The dairy of Kezia was written over roughly a period of four years: 1911-1914 [April 1911-May 1914].</p> 

<p>So far, I have completed transcriptions for April 1911 to December 1911; however, only April, May, and June are finalized with annotations and footnotes. The entries are sectioned chronologically and by month. While separating into three various webpages has no claim to authorial sanction, keeping them in their original sequence by day maintains the author’s original intent.</p>  

<p>...</p> 

<p>On the left side bar, I have provided the editions style guide that the reader can refer to while reviewing the finalized text. Subsequently, I discuss my emendations in detail as well as the textual acts Kezia made in the journal.</p> 

<h6>EDITORAL EMENDATIONS</h6>  
  
<h3>Edits for Textual Clarity</h3> 

<p>First, I have added day of the week before each entry as a heading listed above the text so that the transcription accurately reflects the line/sentence length of each original entry.</p>  

<p>Second, I have bolded each date to help define between date and the start of the entry.</p>    

<p>Last, I include page numbers that denote the shift to a new within the diary. The page numbers are enclosed with square brackets and I have added a black space before and after to allow white space for easy transition.</p>   

<h3><span style="color: #FF9900">Verb Tense</span></h3>  

	<p>First, I’ve <strong><em>silently</em></strong> emended Kezia’s use of verb tense for the verb “to come.” While I have taken pause in my initial transcription, I have transcribed entries from April 1911 to December 1911. In all of the entries, Kezia consistently  used “to come” incorrectly: instead of past tense “came” she used “come.” I have emended, using the correct verb tense to make the text readable and easy to navigate.</p>  

<p>Any other incorrect use of verb tense&nbsp; or word choice will be denoted in <span style="color: #FF9900">ORANGE</span>. I have also emended the incorrect to the correct, and provide footnotes that offer the Kezia’s original verb tense and my emendation.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #FF9900">Subscript</span></h3> 

<p>I will also use <span style="color: #FF9900">ORANGE</span> to denote the times when Kezia used the incorrect subscript for days of the month.</p>   

<h3><span style="color: #0070C0">Capitalization</span></h3> 

<p>I have capitalized the first letter of the first word of a new sentence, which reflects Kezia’s practice elsewhere. However, to denote my edit from her original work it is coded in <span style="color: #0070C0">BLUE</span>.</p>


<h3><span style="color: #0070C0">Punctuation</span></h3>

<p>First, there a few cases in which either the age of the document or close nature of the work, a dash between “to” and “day” is missing. Instead of “today,” “tonight,” and “tomorrow,” Kezia placed a hyphen after “to” for the words. I have edited the places in which it is or may be missing to reflect Kezia’s practice throughout the text, and have color coded it in the same color.</p>

<p>Second, if a sentence is missing a period I emended it to include one. However, I only made this edit in two cases: not for run on sentences, usually when I know that a brand new thought is taking place, usually the first sentence of the entry, and then I have capitalized the first letter on the following word/sentence [1] [2] only if I found it necessary for the reader’s clarity. In addition, I have included a period in the places where Kezia writes “Mr” and “Mrs”</p>   

<p>Third, there are some cases where Kezia uses an apostrophe and other times she doesn’t for the sake of clarity, I’ve add apostrophes to nouns that need them [correct term for plural or possessive nouns] however, since there are some cases where I could not find any information on the historical places, it can be said that for example “Tompsons” is correct instead of “Tompson’s”.</p>

<p>Thus, All emendations in punctuation denoted in <span style="color: #0070C0">BLUE</span>.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0070C0">Additions</span></h3>
	
<p>Any words that Kezia adds later, for example a word squeezed in between two other words I use <span style="color: #0070C0">^</span> color coded in <span style="color: #0070C0">BLUE</span>.</p> 

<h3><span style="color: #CC00FF ">[Questionable Readings]</span></h3>

<p>Questionable readings of words or letters are also   square-bracketed; however, in this case they denoted in <span style="color: #CC00FF ">[BRIGHT PURPLE]</span>. Further, questionable readings usually occurred when Kezia wrote in pencil, and due to old age, the finalized text includes my interpretation. Nevertheless, for most cases I provide annotations with an image of questionable text from the original entry so that readers have access and ability to transcribe themselves to see if they can decipher.</p>   

<h3><span style="color: #D60093">Spelling</span></h3>  

<p>Rather than correcting obvious misspellings in order to reflect the true nature of the work and its author, instead I have denote them in <span style="color: #D60093">PINK</span>. I also offer annotations with an image of the text and a footnote with the correct spelling.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #7030A0">Line Structure</span></h3>

<p>There are various places in the text where Kezia uses the space below the last ruled line of the page to finalize her thoughts. This occurrence is denoted with in <span style="color: #7030A0">PURPLE</span>.</p>  

<h3><strong>[</strong>Word Interpolation<strong>]</strong></h3>
 <p>When a word or letter(s) of word is obviously missing in the entry, I have interpolated the most likely choice, enclosing it with square brackets. I provide annotations with an image of the likely missing text to offer readers a chance to determine for themselves.</p>
