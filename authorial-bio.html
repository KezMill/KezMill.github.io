<h1>AUTHORIAL BIOGRAPHY</h1>
<article>
<p>While this digital edition focuses on Kezia’s diary entries from 1911,
I have provided key biographical information that helps frame the finalized text.</p>

<p>The last section, titled “Letter to JoElissa,” offers partial transcriptions of a <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal1">letter</button>
from Evelyn Ehlers <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. It was written on September 30, 1997, and sent to my nana, 
	<button class="modal-button" href="#myModal2">JoElissa Larsen</button>, on October 3. For this particular transcription, I have made silent emendations 
to offer a clear finalized text, but with three exceptions:</p>

<p>First, there are a couple of passages that could be triggering. In inclined to overlook,
<span style="color: #FF0000">**</span><strong><em>red</em></strong> asterisks enclose these instances.
<span style="color: #FF0000">**</span></p>

<p>Second, if necessary, I’ve removed irrelevant text to save space and time. I’ve denoted 
this emendation by employing ellipses.</p> 

<p>Third, the letter transcriptions in the final section are from one of two letters
Evelyn sent to my Nana: the second was written on August 20, 2001. The 2001
letter is a version of the 1997 letter, with a few variants that proffer a similar
yet further text in which may influence interpretation and/or add to the text’s
meaning. I provide footnotes with text from the 2001 version; these particular
footnotes have been denoted with enclosed brackets.</p> 

<p>Before you begin, please take a moment to review the Parkins family tree below. Feel free to Zoom in on the image with mouse or fingers (if veiwing on your phone).</p>

<h6>FRANCES KEZIA PARKINS</h6>
	
<p>Kezia was born 7 March 1894 in Chapman, Nebraska. 
Throughout her young adult life, she traveled back and forth between 
Chapman, Nebraska and South Bend, Washington—visit the Sociohistorical 
Context page to learn more about South Bend, the geographic setting in
which surrounds the finalized text.</p>


<p>South Bend, Washington seems a bit arbitrary considering the 1,600 mile
distance from Nebraska. However, Kezia’s sister <strong>Evelyn Estelle Parkins</strong>moved there 
shortly after she had married Edwin Fishburn in 1901. It’s believed that 
Evelyn, 17, and Edwin 34, moved to South Bend because Evelyn 
“was afraid of the wind in Nebraska <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>” (1). The lived in South Bend for 
approximately seven to eight years where they had Lawrence, Clarice, and 
Eunice  before moving to Portland, Oregon. In Portland, <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal3">Evelyn</button> learned 
she was pregnant, when Eunice was 12 or 13. <span style="color: #FF0000">**</span>“Evelyn used a knitting needle to 
abort the baby and died of infection in 1919.<span style="color: #FF0000">**</span></p>

<p>During the years of 1923, Kezia lived with her mother, Melissa Hudnall Parkins, 
and two brothers Elisha and Joe in Chapman, Nebraska, along with <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal4">Phil Vermillion</button>
who they hired to help with work around the property. The home they all lived in 
had four rooms, a large kitchen, two bedrooms, a living room, and two porches. 
Kezia shared a room with her mother, and Elisha and Joe shared the other bedroom. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p> 

<p>It is believed that Phil wanted to marry Kezia, however, she wasn’t interested
in him romantically. Inevitably, that did not sit well with Phil, and as a result 
Elisha mortgaged the farm to pay him off since Phil “wanted what 
he figured his pay for all the years he’d been the hired man” (1).</p> 

<p>Before Kezia met Earl Key, she was became enamored with a man 
	named <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal5">Ed Hoy</button>. He had been teaching Kezia’s niece, Evelyn (Chandler) 
music lessons at Melissa’s, her grandmother, home. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Ed played for one 
of the local theatres and gave Evelyn piano lessons. Kezia “fell in love 
with Ed, but he didn’t want to get married, even though she took piano 
lessons at the conservatory so he’d like her better” (3). Even though a 
marriage didn’t manifest, her love for the piano and her skills proffered her
a part-time job as a piano teacher herself. </p>

	<p>In 1933, <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal6">Kezia married Earl</button> Richard Key on November 26. It is believed she married Earl 
“because he was a hard worked and quite handsome, and ‘couldn’t help’, 
the uncles thought” (1). They moved to a farm nearby and Kezia fixed up that 
home as well. However, they didn’t live there very long because they were back 
at her mother’s house, when Kezia fell ill and passed after giving birther to her 
first, and only, child: Jo Elissa Snyder (Key).</p>

<p>For reasons unknown, <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal12">Bessie's (Parkins)</button> marriage to Purl Chandler ended in 1930. 
However, in 1935 Bessie remarried to Llyod Snyder. After Kezia passed, 
Earl found himself unable to raise a daughter alone. For that reason, Bessie 
and Lloyd adopted JoElissa. Unfortunately, when JoElissa was around the age 
of five, Bessie passed, leaving Lloyd to raise her. Lloyd was an incredible 
father, and true blessing for JoElissa.</p> 

<p>The following excerpts are from a letter Evelyn’s diary that she
transcribed in the letter (3-4) that give wonderful—nevertheless 
heartbreaking—details about Kezia in 1936:</p>

<h6>LETTER TO JOELISSA</h6>

	<p><button class="modal-button" href="#myModal7">Sept. 16, 1936</button>: Jo Elissa Key was born at 10:30 p.m. Aunt Kezia had eaten 
a big bunch of grapes that evening, and when she went into labor she 
wanted Mama <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> to stay with her, so Mama was present in the O.R. when 
they operated on her. <span style="color: #FF0000">**</span>Mama said they piled her intestines on her chest, 
took you out, piled the intestines back in, any which way, sewed her help 
and took her to a room.<span style="color: #FF0000">**</span> [Mama said that the only thing that kept her 
from fainting was her prayers]. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Sept. 20, 1936</strong>s: Ruby and Happ<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> came, to tell us that Aunt K. was worse, so after O <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> and 
Happ got the chores done, we drove to <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal8">Grand Island</button>. Aunt K. was pretty bad. We saw Jo. Sure cute. Left at 11, 
and got to Chapman about 11:30. The uncles <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> got up, and we talked till 12.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 22, 1936</strong>: … we all went back to see Aunt K. She was better, and know 
what she was saying….</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 28, 1936</strong>: A card came from Mama saying that the doctors give no hope for Aunt K.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 23, 1936</strong>: The uncles and Mama came to say Aunt K. had nearly died, but was to get well, 
now. They stayed the night. 
</p>

<p><button class="modal-button" href="#myModal9"><strong>Oct. 12, 1936</strong></button>: Ruby and Uncle Joe came to say Aunt K. was very low, so we went to G. I. <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> to 
the hospital where they said she wouldn’t live through the night.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 13, 1936</strong>: We got to the hospital and found Aunt K. in a coma. She gradually got worse all day, 
and at 7 she died. We waited until the undertaker from Central City came, then O. took us back to 
the farm and he went home.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 15, 1936</strong>: They brought Aunt Kezia. She wore her <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal10">[wedding dress]</button> and looked so nice. Services were 
at 2:00 … The neighbor ladies served supper that night at the farm where the <button class="modal-button" href="#myModal11">funeral</button> was held.</p>

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Throughout Kezia's diary entries, she references Phil many, many times. He is friend of Kezia, the brother of Marguerite and Rebecca - who are also referenced in the text. It is interesting because a lot of the surrounding families and friends of the Parkins in Nebraska, either visit or spend time in South Bend, too. I have no confirmation if the following image [Fig. 1] is Phil Vermillion. However, I've compared the handwriting characteristics found on the back of the photo [Fig 2.] with those from a letter Phil wrote Kezia in 1919 [Fig. 3 and Fig. 4] If you look closely at the letter "K" you will see striking similarity.</p>
