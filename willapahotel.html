<h3>"The Hotel that Never Was"</h3>
<p>Buried deep in the voluminous history of the former Northern Pacific Railway in the records of “Northern Land Development Company'' is the story of the hotel that never served a paying guest.</p>
 
<p>Robert Ripley's researchers most certainly would devote the better portion of a page in one of their “Believe It Or Not” pocket books to the Willapa Hotel in South Bend, Wash.</p>

<p>We often think of today's times as being productive of instant obsolescence. Cars, appliances, apartment buildings, apparel items, etc., quickly become unwanted or unneeded either through shoddy construction or changing fashion. In that respect, the Willapa Hotel back in 1891 might have been a trend-setter, because it had outlived its usefulness even before it was completed.</p>

<p>Records indicate that big things were planned for South Bend, Wash., in the 1890s. The town had an advantageous location as a port on the Pacific Ocean at Willapa Bay. An enterprising individual, one General James M. Ashton, saw South Bend as something of a San Francisco of the Pacific Northwest and convinced the Northern Land and Development Company (an NP subsidiary) to donate him 40 lots for a hotel site with the condition that a hotel "costing not less than $25,000 would be erected thereon." </p>

<p>The Northern Land and Development had the land to give to General Ashton only because the good townsfolk of South Bend had donated it to the firm in hopes of getting NP rail service.</p>

<p>General Ashton was by no means a frugal man, and it didn't take him long after construction began in 1891 exceed his $25,000 limit. The building itself, a modest 100 foot-by-200 foot, four-story structure, was not particularly expensive to construct. But the general went all out in decorating the lobby and parlor, sending the cost soaring over $100,000. According to NP records, the majority of the hotel was constructed with native woods, but the lobby and parlor were "finished in eastern oak and California redwood was also used in the interior. It is related that Henry Villard (then NP president) brought an expert wood carver from Germany to carve the oak mantles surrounding the fireplaces."</p>

<p>Just as the building was nearing completion, disaster struck General Ashton, the Northern Land and Development Company, the Northern Pacific railroad, and in fact, the entire nation. The Great Financial Panic of 1893 wiped out people, industries, factories, institutions, and railroads, among them the Northern Pacific Railroad. Northern Pacific was forced into receivership and stayed there for three years.</p>

<p>The Willapa Hotel never opened and South Bend never became another San Francisco. A footnote if to the Willapa Hotel story mentions that the facility, if only for a few hours, partially served one of the purposes of its construction. In 1895 or 1896 (no one seems to know for sure) the officers of the <em>U.S. Monitor Monterey</em> hosted their ladies to a grand dance in the hotel ballroom.</p>

<p>A brief flicker, then oblivion.</p>

<p>The record on the hotel closes with the notation: “With the changing conditions, the building appeared unsuited to the needs of South Bend, and it was sold and wrecked.”</p>
